#function is a fisrt class citizen. beacuse it is stored as value.
#if a function is called with parenthesis that time it is meant that the function is invoked, that means it is give a return result. if function is called without parenthesis, it means it is give the work of the function  not the returning result.
Exemple:-
  1. const fn=functionTst(); it return value in fn
  2. const fn=fuinctonTst; it store the work on functonTst in fn
